  CHAPTER 4 - EXERCISE 1

  THE SUM OF RANGE

  The introduction of this book alluded to the following as a nice way to
  compute the sum of a range of numbers:

    console.log(sum(range(1, 10)));

  Write a 'range' function that takes two arguments, start and end, and
  returns an array containing all the numbers from start up to (and
  including) end.

  Next, write a 'sum' function that takes an array of numbers and returns the
  sum of these numbers. Run the example program and see whether it does
  indeed return 55.

  As a bonus assignment, modify your 'range' function to take an optional
  third argument that indicates the “step” value used when building the array.
  If no step is given, the elements go up by increments of one, corresponding
  to the old behavior. The function call range(1, 10, 2) should return [1, 3,
  5, 7, 9]. Make sure it also works with negative step values so that range(5,
  2, -1) produces [5, 4, 3, 2].

// range
function range(start, end, step = start <= end ? 1 : -1) {
  let outputArray = [];
  for (let i = start; step == 1 ? i <= end : end <= i; i += step) {
    outputArray.push(i);
  }
  return outputArray;
}


// sum
function sum(coefs) {
  let result = 0;
  for (let coef of coefs) {
    result += coef;
  }
  return result;
}
